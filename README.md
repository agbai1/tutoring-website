## Tutoring-Website

This is a personal project that I created for my final year Web Design Class at University of Baltimore

The Project is about designing a website and adding a js and php feature to it.

For my Project, I decided to create a tutoring website, since I am a tutor and I am hoping to launch the site 
in the near feature. The site includes a data base that allows users to create login details and then login to 
the site with the login created..

More features will be added and I will update this file when that happens!
